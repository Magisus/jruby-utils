    // The `LockingPool` contract requires some synchronization behaviors that

    // and hold off any pending pool borrowers until unlock() is called.
    // This class implementation fulfills the contract by managing the
    // synchronization constructs directly rather than deferring to an
    // underlying JDK data structure to manage concurrent access.
    //
    // This implementation is modeled somewhat off of what the
    // `LinkedBlockingDeque` class in the OpenJDK does to manage
    // concurrency.  It uses a single `ReentrantLock` to provide mutual
    // exclusion around offer and take requests, with condition variables
    // used to park and later reawaken requests as needed, e.g., when pool
    // items are unavailable for borrowing or when the pool lock is
    // unavailable.
    //
